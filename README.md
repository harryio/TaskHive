# Backstory
In the beginning, there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>. It functioned as a reasonable marketplace for simplistic automatable tasks, while suffering the inconvenience of requiring an AmazonPay account and restricting offers to US only. With improvements to automation technology, primarily the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_%28software%29">Selenium</a> headless browser, the automatable task market bottomed out. From this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiverr">Fiverr</a> was born. Over-commercialization of this site provoked an identity crisis, in which it began modeling itself as a more professional crowdsourced work network, only lacking comparable quality. Far from a free or open source solution, <i>Fiverr effectively blocks Tor users from participating in this network and requires identity verification through Paypal to participate.</i>

Free Open Source Software (FOSS) continues to pick up the pieces where corporate greed and corruption have failed. While corporations were busy worrying about who to restrict access to, FOSS enthusiasts were happily building tools that work for everyone. Those tools are the foundation of taskhive and we are proud to incorporate them to further the reach of the crowdsourced work market, and provide opportunities to those who would otherwise be held back by the adverse effects of corporate corruption.
